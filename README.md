# ng2-flatpickr
Angular 2+ wrapper for flatpickr

```javascript
npm install --save ng2-flatpickr
```

Flatpickr css needs to be loaded separately. when using `@angular/cli`, load it in `angular-cli.json`.

```javascript
      "styles": [
        "../node_modules/flatpickr/dist/flatpickr.min.css"
      ]
```

### v0.1.x
For figuring out stuff.

### v0.2
Usable in forms (FormBuilder, formControlName). Expected on 7th March.
